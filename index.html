              <a href="https://blastuptoken.github.io/">BlastUP </a> is the first
              launchpad based on Blast. It enables teams to raise capital in a
              decentralized, safe, and user-friendly environment while rewarding
              active participants through the Community Incentives Program.
            </p>

            <p>
              BlastUP's mission is encapsulated in the short slogan “Grow
              faster, earn more” bringing together the interests of participants
              and projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              BlastUP believes in Blast because it is the first Ethereum L2 with
              native yield for ETH and stablecoins. Blast became the first L2
              protocol to reach 1 billion TVL in 35 days. This creates a strong
              competitive advantage over existing L2 networks and introduces new
              DeFi mechanics.
            </p>

            <p>
              We encourage projects built on Blast to reach out to us for
              collaboration opportunities. If this is of interest to you, please
              submit your application here.

              BLP is a native token of BlastUP which serves as the cornerstone
              of its ecosystem. This token provides a robust framework for
              financial transactions and enhances user engagement through
              staking. Additionally, BLP supports seed staking, allowing token
              holders to earn interest and gain exclusive loyalty rewards for
              participating in Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs). Holders of the
              BlastUP Token also receive allocated portions of token sales from
              projects launched on the platform. This community-driven approach
              ensures active holder involvement in the platform’s development.
            </p>

            <p>The utilities of BLP tokens include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>➡️Access to tiered IDO launches on BlastUP.</li>
              <li>➡️The ability to stake BlastUP tokens to earn rewards.</li>
              <li>➡️A buy-back mechanism for BlastUP tokens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Buy BLP Tokens Now?</h2>
            <p>
              BLP tokens stand out as a particularly compelling choice for both
              seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers. Here’s why considering
              BLP for a crypto portfolio could be a wise decision:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                ➡️ <strong>Utility and Versatility:</strong> BLP tokens are
                integral within the BlastUP ecosystem, used for transactions,
                access to exclusive features, and more.
              </li>
              <li>
                ➡️ <strong>Limited Supply:</strong> With a capped total supply,
                BLP tokens are designed to maintain scarcity, potentially
                increasing in value as the platform grows.
              </li>
              <li>
                ➡️ <strong>Rewarding Potential:</strong> BLP tokens give its
                holders access to Airdrops, token allocations for participation
                in IDOs, and the ability to earn interest from staking.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              And the most compelling reason is the price. The current presale
              of BLP tokens provides an opportunity for a smartinvestment with
              high potential ROI. Some experts say that the fair $BLP price is
              $10 while currently it is sold out at less than 10 US cents.
            </p>

            <h2>Tokenomics of BLP</h2>

            <p>
              The allocation of BLP tokens is planned to ensure sustainable
              growth and utility within the BlastUP ecosystem. A significant
              portion of tokens is reserved for providing incentives to the
              platform users which promotes active participation and long-term
              engagement. Another portion is allocated to the team and advisors,
              subject to vesting periods to align their interests with the
              long-term success of the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Buy BLP Token?</h2>
            <p>
              As already mentioned, BLP tokens are in presale currently, which
              means they are not available on a decentralized exchange yet, but
              can be bought on the blastup.io only. The purchase of BLP tokens
              is available with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or fiat money via a bank
              card.
            </p>

            <p>
              To buy BLP tokens, a user needs to connect their wallet through
              the “Connect Wallet” option on the website, using one of available
              networks. Then it is necessary to specify the amount they wish to
              exchange for $BLP Tokens. Upon clicking “Buy Now,” the transaction
              must be approved in the wallet. After completion, the acquisition

            <p>
              BlastUP plans to distribute a portion of $BLP tokens through an
              Airdrop to support early participants. To provide a seamless
              experience on airdrop we are using Booster Points as a mechanism
              to effectively spread $BLP for our community.

            <h2>BlastUP token price prediction</h2>
            <p>
              BlastUP has effectively demonstrated its commitment to its motto,
              “grow faster, earn more,” by launching the CYBRO project’s token
              sale in April, even while BlastUP itself remains in the presale
              phase. This alpha sale is a significant milestone that showcases
              the innovative capabilities of the BlastUP platform.
